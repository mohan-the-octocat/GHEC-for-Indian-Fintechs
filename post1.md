# **The Evolution of Application Development in Large Indian BFSIs & NBFCs**

## **Part 1: The Changing Landscape of Application Development in BFSI**

### **How Big Banks Built Software the Old-School Way**
Large Indian banks and NBFCs have been stuck in a time loop when it comes to software development. Picture this: massive **monolithic architectures**, decades-old **core banking systems**, and **waterfall-style development cycles** that move at the speed of a tortoise in quicksand. Here’s the typical setup:
- **On-premise infra** that’s locked down tighter than Fort Knox.
- **Multi-month SDLCs** where updates take longer than your home loan approval.
- **Third-party vendors** handling most of the heavy lifting.
- **Compliance-driven everything**, meaning innovation takes a backseat.

While these approaches provided **stability and regulatory compliance**, they also created **stiff, slow-moving IT environments**—a nightmare in today’s fast-paced digital world.

### **Enter the Disruptors: FinTechs, Digital Lenders & Small Finance Banks**

Then along came the new-age players—**FinTechs, Small Finance Banks (SFBs), and digital lenders**—who basically looked at traditional banking and said, *“Yeah, we can do this better.”* And they did. 

Here’s how they flipped the script:
- **Cloud-native everything**: No clunky on-prem infra, just scalable AWS/GCP/Azure setups.
- **Microservices & APIs**: Built like LEGO blocks, not one massive, unchangeable chunk.
- **AI-driven decisioning**: Machine learning for credit risk, fraud detection, and automation.
- **Rapid iteration cycles**: Shipping updates faster than your favorite food delivery app.
- **Hyper-personalization**: Using data to make sure customers feel like VIPs, not account numbers.

These challengers embraced **automation, data analytics, and AI** to scale at **light speed**, leaving traditional BFSIs in a cloud of dust.

### **The Big Bank Blues: Challenges in a Disrupted Market**

With these FinTechs running circles around them, big banks are facing some serious hurdles. Here’s where the pain points hit hardest:

🔴 **Legacy Tech That Just Won’t Die**: Some banks still run **mainframe-based core banking systems from the '90s**. Modernization feels like defusing a bomb—one wrong move, and everything crashes.

🔴 **Glacial Development Cycles**: While FinTechs are pushing updates **daily**, traditional BFSIs struggle with **6-12 month release cycles**. By the time an update goes live, customer expectations have already shifted.

🔴 **Regulatory Tug-of-War**: Banks have to **walk a tightrope** between **compliance** (RBI rules, data residency laws) and **innovation** (cloud adoption, AI, DevOps).

🔴 **Data Security & Privacy Jitters**: Banks have to **lock down data like it’s the nuclear codes**, while FinTechs find creative ways to work with data **without breaking the law**.

🔴 **The Outsourcing Dilemma: No Source Code, No Control**: Many banks **outsource app dev to third-party vendors** who deliver only the **binaries**—aka *“Here’s your app, but don’t ask us for the source code.”* This creates:
- **Vendor lock-in hell**: Can’t tweak, can’t innovate, can’t move fast.
- **Security black holes**: No visibility into potential vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance headaches**: RBI wants banks to have **more control over IT assets**, but many don’t.

🔴 **Talent & Culture Shock**: Agile? DevOps? AI-driven automation? For many banks, these are **buzzwords, not realities**. Legacy mindsets make it hard to **attract top engineering talent** or change workflows.

### **So, What’s Next?**
Large BFSIs are at a **crossroads**—they either **modernize or become obsolete**. To stay relevant, they need to:
- **Move to agile, DevOps, and CI/CD** to speed up software releases.
- **Leverage cloud-native infrastructure** while keeping regulators happy.
- **Integrate AI-driven risk & fraud detection** into applications.
- **Demand source code ownership** from vendors or build more in-house capabilities.
- **Embrace a security-first mindset** without slowing down innovation.

In the next part of this series, we’ll dive into **how GitHub’s enterprise solutions can help BFSIs modernize their software development while staying 100% compliant with RBI regulations**.
