## **Inside Left (Page 2 - Fold 2) – The Compliance Challenge & Key Pain Points**
### **What are the RBI Master Directions, and why do they matter?**
The **RBI Master Directions on IT Governance (2023)** require Financial Institutions to:
✔ **Own and control their source code** to reduce third-party dependency.

✔ **Strengthen resilience with business continuity planning.**

❗ **Non-compliance is costly** – Over **₹40 crore in penalties** imposed since 2022 (Source: RBI Press Releases, 2023).

### **Challenges Slowing Financial Institutions**
🚨 **Third-Party Dependency Risks** – Many institutions receive only **binaries, not source code**, locking them out of their own apps.  
🚨 **Slow, Bureaucratic Release Cycles** – FinTechs deploy daily, while banks take **months**.  
🚨 **Security Bottlenecks** – Siloed teams, slow audits, and **manual security checks** delay go-to-market timelines.  
🚨 **Lack of Real-time Compliance** – Most compliance checks happen **AFTER development**, leading to costly rework.  
🚨 **Tool Fragmentation** – Too many security tools, audits, and approvals slow down progress.
